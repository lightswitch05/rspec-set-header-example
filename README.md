This is an example app for a question [posted on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25815741/set-header-in-rspec-3-request)

Question
--------

I'm trying to set the header for some RSpec requests that require authentication. The header is ACCESS_TOKEN. No matter how I attempt to set the header, it never gets set. I know the app works because I can manually test it, I just cant get rspec tests to work
